# About

This prototype is not exactly an actual game. It was developed to serve as a demonstration for a “Game feel” talk in 2019 at the ENJMIN school.

It shows the impact of small details on the overall quality of a game.

You will need a GAMEPAD to test it. You can enable or disable game features in this demo by pressing the START button.

# Compiling

You should read the instructions on my GameBase project (https://github.com/deepnight/gameBase).
